This is my new portfolio. I put a lot of work into the design, which is inspired by the posters of Otto Baumberger and involves some cool scrolling effects. It is built on Nextjs.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
