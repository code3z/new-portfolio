  In fall 2023, I started researching going to Nairobi on a gap year. I was
  interested in going to Africa, it seemed new and different and has more
  pressing problems to work on than Silicon Valley does. The startups in Africa
  are mainly in Lagos and Nairobi (and also Egypt and South Africa, but I wasn't
  as interested in going there). Lagos has a reputation as being dangerous, so I
  picked Nairobi.

I found Kyle because he had the top answer on Quora to "Is Nairobi Safe?", I reached out to him and eventually got an internship. I worked mainly on [https://sunlight.reviews](https://sunlight.reviews), a database for entrepreneurs to review funders. Funders are often bureaucratic and slow, but some aren't. We wanted to find the good ones. We're still looking for more reviews, please share!

During the trip I travelled over Nairobi and Kenya. I went with Kyle to a meeting with USAID in Nanyuki, we crossed the equator and went go-karting. I went mountain biking, bowling, dancing, and more in Nairobi. My mom stayed for a week, and we went to Naivasha and Nairobi National Park. I met lots of cool people staying at [The Warren](https://maps.app.goo.gl/V2ayVkWMDhGG7dKCA) in Westlands, Nairobi. A friend that I originally met when we rejected him for the [demo day](https://teenfounders.vercel.app/) took me to his home in Juja and then to his village near Nakuru for 3 days. It was amazing to see village life; everyone was so welcoming and I got plenty of free food. The downtown was lively and the views were great. Though the toilets were not what I'm used to, and I fell off a motorbike.
