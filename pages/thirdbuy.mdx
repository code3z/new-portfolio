  In August of 2022, I went to New York and happened to meet [Gabriel
  Romualdo](https://gabrielromualdo.com/). He ran Thirdbuy, a crypto startup
  that at the time had a product for buying items online with crypto, and he
  gave me a generous job offer when we first met. He was 17 and had already
  worked as an engineering manager at a unicorn startup and raised a pre-seed (though it was in a
  time when that was very easy to do for a crypto startup). I was intrigued.

I later had a formal interview, and started working as a paid intern (as a trial period) from October to mid-November, and then part-time since. I've learned a lot here, including:

- How to build a product from scratch, and decide what to build
- Good and bad management practices
- While meetings are often criticised now, it can be really helpful to work in sync with a team while coding
- How to better communicate on a team - I've seen both good and bad things that will be very helpful experience for whatever I do next
- I've gotten an idea of how to balance being frugal vs. spending money on software and teams
- Being able to manage time between everything, after agreeing to work a certain number of hours a week
- Feedback is super important when done right
