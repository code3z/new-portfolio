In summer 2022, I started an internship at Dots (I wrote about how I got it in
[my post about shareweave](/shareweave)). It was an incredible experience. One
of the cofounders had been to USC and McKinsey, and the other had graduated
from Princeton, and they both
went to Y Combinator with this startup. They had a lot of experience to learn from.

As my first time working on an engineering team, I learned a lot about the process and best practices. But in
my time at Dots, I also got to try doing sales/outreach (one of the people I
reached out to introduced me to the guy who hired me next), and did a lot of
different aspects of engineering: frontend, backend, implementing designs,
working with millions of pieces of data, and even making their first web3
feature. They were impressed with my work and I continued working into the
fall, but eventually made the hard decision to leave for a job at
[thirdbuy](/thirdbuy).
