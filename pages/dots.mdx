In summer 2022, I started an internship at Dots (I wrote about how I got it in
[my post about shareweave](/shareweave)). It was an incredible experience. One
of the cofounders had been to USC and McKinsey, and the other had graduated
from Princeton, so they were experienced in the corporate world, and they both
had been to YC with this startup. They had a lot of experience and insights to
bring to the table when building the product.

As my first time working on an engineering team, I learned a lot about the process and best practices. But in
my time at Dots, I also got to try doing sales/outreach (one of the people I
reached out to introduced me to the guy who hired me next), and did a lot of
different aspects of engineering: frontend, backend, implementing designs,
working with millions of pieces of data, and even making their first web3
feature. They were impressed with my work and I continued working into the
fall, but eventually made the hard decision to leave to work at
[thirdbuy](/thirdbuy).
